# Dog-Food-Project

This is a Read Me for my Github repo for Dog Food Project 

Edge Cases:
 
1. What if there are zero dogs
2. Too much food ordered
3. Food surplus is exhausted too quickly
4. multiple orders placed at once
5. Zero surplus from prior month
6. MORE than 30 dogs
7. Months with more or less than 30 days
8. characters or letters entered

Considerations: 

- Where will Order info be stored
- How many simultaneous orders can be placed
- Min & max dog food that can be ordered
- Is shelter inside or outside U.S (measurement units)

Error Cases: 

- What happens if user inputs letters or symbols

AC: 

- Given the number of each size of dogs currently in your shelter and the remaining food from last month then
  function should return how much you should order.
